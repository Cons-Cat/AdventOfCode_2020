To study the Rust programming language, and improve my Vimming meanwhile, I am attempting last year's Advent of Code.

* Day 1
** Part 1
I solved this problem recursively. I passed the data into a function which compares the first element to every other element of the array.
Then it passes a slice of its input, excluding the first element, into itself. When two elements that are compared equal =2020=, it returns.
If the size of the input is less than 2, it returns an error.
** Part 2
The challenge of Day 2 is to make my previous solution scale.
It is only required to evaluate three items, but I felt it was in the spirit of this challenge to write a solution that has truly arbitrary parameters.
My recursive function now nests itself =n= times deep to find elements that sum to =2020=.
