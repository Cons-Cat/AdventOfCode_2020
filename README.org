To study the Rust programming language, and improve my Vimming meanwhile, I am attempting last year's Advent of Code.

* Day 1
I solved this problem recursively. I passed the data into a function which compares the first element to every other element of the array.
Then it passes a slice of its input, excluding the first element, into itself. When two elements that are compared equal =2020=, it returns.
If the size of the input is less than 2, it returns an error.
